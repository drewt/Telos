Telos - README

--- ABOUT ---
Telos is a (non-reentrant) preemptive multitasking kernel.

--- COMPILING ---
Running `make' in this directory should build the kernel and make a bootable
floppy image if you have the cross-compiler (i586-elf-gcc) installed.

--- RUNNING ---
Run `bochs' in this directory once the floppy image has been made.  At the grub
prompt, enter `kernel 200+900' and then `boot' to boot the kernel (900 is just
a large number that's easy to type quickly, don't read anything into it).

--- TSH ---
Enter `help' at the prompt for a list of commands.
