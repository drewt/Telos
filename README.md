About

Telos is a simple x86 kernel, supporting:

* preemptive multitasking
* processes running in kernel- and user-mode
* POSIX signals (partial)
* message passing IPC
* rudimentary paging (WIP)


Building
--------

You'll need a recent version of gcc with support for the i386 target.

    $ make


Running
-------

To run the kernel in QEMU,

    $ ./qemu

or Bochs,

    $ bochs


TSH

Telos comes with a basic shell and a few programs (mostly tests).  Type 'help'
at the prompt for a list of commands.
