About
-----

Telos is a simple x86 kernel, supporting:

* preemptive multitasking
* processes running in kernel- and user-mode
* copy-on-write and demand paging
* a virtual filesystem layer
* memory-mapped files
* POSIX signals
* POSIX timers
* ...and more

Building
--------

You'll need a recent version of gcc with support for the i386 target.

    $ make

Running
-------

To run the kernel in QEMU,

    $ ./qemu

tsh
---

Telos comes with a basic shell and a few programs.  Most of these programs
are placeholders for testing until a more complete user space is available.
